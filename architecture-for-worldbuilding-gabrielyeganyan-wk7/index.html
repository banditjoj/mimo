7</h1><p>--palladio in LA</p><p>renaissance architect</p><p>&quot;why do i see perspective then if its ortho&quot;</p><p>theres
fake perspective built into it. the interesting thing is nobody had
done that in a while. the proportions elegance statuary and design was
revived and they didnt have for 1500 yrs. one of those ren architects
that codified and helped define the style. youll see it everywhere now
and even here at the pasadena city hall.</p><p>10 books on architecture</p><p>there
wasnt that much strict order. its kind of figuring out a set of rules
thats elegant and nice. he created a stamp for the city around it. it
implies this new language thats been defined. thats a theater and wahts
cool is that hes an architect. theater and architect relationship.
becomes a core aspect of baroque architecture. movies set in italy are
unfairly beautiful bc it was done by design.
feels theres gonna be a crossing of architecture and concept art. some gigs ive gotten
want sensibilities of an illustrator.</p><p>right side-</p><p>this
was what you can get from a modern sense. everything about this still
has the soul of palladios and rome, but distilled down. its very honest
about what it is and doesnt decorate for what its not.
each precedent is different in the book. they curate who they ask.
architectural
historian. think through design with words and analysis. then youre
really forced to read into ideas. documentaries and stuff.
it doesnt have to be a full essay but jnust look into something interesting. 7th century or
something
what is this location. who was there. what was going on. and it always shows up.
its
like a philosphy/polysci class. its way more about what does this say
about the zeitgeist about this movement. super abstract. if you walk
into an architecture review. at some point i was outside of it and then i
went b ack in and they were doing a review of the students and im
listening and just.. the sound of the conversation is kinda high on
itself. its created alanguage of exclusivity with a particular
vernacular. youll be like huh?!?!? they dont have the person feeling and
experiencing it. &quot;this scene is gonna make you feel this way&quot; if you
dont have that then it becomes a weird song and dance</p><p>rikam prikash -- architecutre history book.</p><p>mark</p><p>jarzombek - opposite end of scully. - tried to cover a global history
vs hyperspecific coverage.they cover everything and its chronological</p><p>-sinh--</p><p>makes floor look deeper than it is</p><p>i
dont know if you feel this but did it feel like you shouldnt be drawing
this at all? probably bc it wasnt meant to be seen at that angle. its
designed with the audience in mind. like the palladio design where its
designed with the fake vp. if you look at the building it curves toward you and bulges out. if youre sitting at the auditorium the curvature
flattens it out. its fine you drew it bc youre discovering things about
it. so the whole thing is an illusion. find a youtube walkthrough of it.
those are the best designs for architecture that are built for the
spectator. a lot of concept art that miht work as a 3/4 drawing might
now actually work great for the character playing it. especially for
games. this building is probably really good to struggle with and study.
youll have to think about how the design works outside of your keyshot
throughout that level at every angle throughout the gameplay. then you
have to think this way like the building. its this kind of game of
figuring out vantage points. even in JFO in the temple acts as a
theatrical showcase of their dark era. theres a lot that can be gained
from theaters.
escaping palace -
if youre interested in that
type of story as well and indain aesthetic -- 1940 film - black
narcissist. it has the same kind of theme. the drawing on the right is
what i came to. think about what it means to be lost in it. how it sits
in the landscape. the movie is a good version of feeling disconnected.
try to explore another version of this that distills it down. whats the
core thing here. rather than one building what if its just towers. how
many or how few towers would give you the impact of disconnection or
being lost. can you create the feeling with two towers? as soon as you
look at it itll looks like youve chewed through it. now that you found
the language, allow the language to deconstruct the building to
something new.</p><p>-dany--</p><p>if you go to sf - some areas
there.. same design as the japanese.. its less asymmetrical. idk if this
ones coffered on the interior or not. the one in SF it comes down and
sits on 4 massive concrete braces. like a view beyond san francisco. a
lot of this stuff. the spirit is honesty. not just concrete.
modern building thats jsut a pancake sandwich</p><p>if
the shape of the white on the side was designed precisely for the
intake of air and if the color.. then it would be. xbox is pretty
brutalist then its brutalist. its fine its not invalid but its just
different.</p><p>q: why do a lot of the forms jut out?</p><p>a: you
usually do a cube with dressing, but then brutalism breaks the cube. the
lobby is not the door and window. its a space you can pull out of push
in. maybe the second floor is a loung area. theyll usually exaggerate
that area and pull it out just so its distinct from the rest. its still
expressive but maybe therye exaggerating a unique area of the building
of a function. the rest of it is kind of just playing with structure
just because they can. once they figure out a certain technique it kind
of proliferates to everything. the other thing that does it is each
culture trying to put a stits a sysstem of structure that allows the
building to take shape. they found an interesting shape like the roman
column that becomes structure to hold the roof up.. and it makes the
shape of the building. for this other one.. the structural thing is this
wing shape piece. theyre providing the strucutre but also not providing
the structure. theyre using the concrete and the engineering to create
that step by step. and then it slowly opens up to the audience. it pulls
you compositionally but on the bottom is still fundamentally
structural. it shows yo uand breaks it at the same time. brazil. its the
same thing but at a much smaller scal.e the pyramid shape being the
most singular idea of structure.. now you can achieve scale through this
system that maybe when you enter this thing.. if you if you enter
dark.. then this time it might be light on the inside. how new concrtee
can achieve this contradictory experience. this is kind of building off
the cathedral. but strip awy the decoration and it looks brutalist. all
this engineering th makes it work.. for catheral the outside looks
engineering heavy while on the inside its all light. originally. if you
go into a modern cathedral it should be a glowing box of light. this
ones doing it with engineering. so that it maintinas a clear shap. all
of these are doing one large shape out of large subsidairy structuralshapes. this ones doing it at a higher frequency. or a smaller scale
which is intentional to create the illustion of mass again to where it
looks solid. yhou couldnt do this with this other shape language. so
that it looks lik a texture.. amp on it.
but fundamentally it
still contradicts it when you enter and itll all be light inside. thats
how all these belong together. its jsut a different shape language of
cubes and columns holding the cubes. both are obvious in what its trying
to do immediately. balconies and ockets of space w/ its own private
area to where its legible.thats what theyre doing. its like mayan
temples. like a breadcrumb trail. the idea of brutalism. the concrete
technology.
the important part is that its sparse on decoration.
what can you do with the concrete texturally on the surface. square
relief on the.. but hten it feels like an artistic piece on a building
rather than an building as an artisticpiece.how
can i make the structure of the building fascinating to make it unique
to me, culture, etc. theyre all dealing with column roof and theyre just
remixing to best suit the idea of the building pg 132</p><p>-jacob(?)--</p><p>i
like it. what can you do even from here to make it more honest? is this
middle wall piece a rectangle? or what if it connects diagonally. since
its concrete it doesnt haev to be a cube. keep distilling. in my
sketchbook i have... all different ideations until i got it down to just
the one that i had. keep trying to find it. how much do i cut off. what
angle. do i need more space. keep refining. its a conscious decision.</p><p>me --</p><p>modern but you can see the pieces.
cool
that you found this elevation. you can see how the detailing becomes
Crits - Wk7 FA22 6
just a flow line for this louis kahn building&#x27;s lines. apparently
rudolph was commissioned for the building and just built it so its just
louid and dominates over the other buildings.
if youre ever able to go to yale its very hogwarts.</p><p>-kenneth--</p><p>you
can sculpt with a few brushtrokes with the visual impact of light and
drama. then you can go back in and find the design. and it maintains a
hierarchy for the larger idea.</p><p>julia--</p><p>yeah it kinda looks like they brutalized art deco.
if
you see that initial big swatch get it in and keep it even on the
faster ones. even kinda here too. you can tell its kind of the idea. it
doesnt have. you can read it as a mass. its ominous looking. but also
because it gets dark and grimy over time. as a drawing it looks nice and
light. when yorue drawing you can still try to capture that nuance a
little bit.</p><p>j: liked being inside the museum bc its built in a
way where you travel around it like a spiral. (experience!) it feels
light and airy with so much natural light. if you walk underneath it.
the
main read of this building is about the building against the dark trees
around it. also maybe some of the stuff across the street outside the
bounding box. how they transition into the city. the best architecture
does that really well.
east building national gallery - im pei
theres
a little bit of conversation of the other building. everything on this
one is triangular while the other one is rectangular. context dicating
-- every reason why the way it looks how it does is bc the street meets
at this weird angle. the building next to it has the same problem. its asuper... like the actual national gallery is super roman on a nice
square with squares vs this one as a weird trapezoid.</p><p>j: african american history museum opened up w/ tiny plot of land. if you ever go to DC
you should go there.
<em>internet starts lagging</em>
anyways
that why the trapezoid is so interesting. giving yourself the weirdest
context. give it some kinda strange conditions to adjust to. each facade
would have to be different. i&#x27;ll talk about it in the next essay or
read some stuff about it. its still like.. fundamentally the metaphor of
a ship an modernist architecture. except youre going down below how its
taking the idea and using it to tell that particular story. the core of
the building is underneat and not this thing on top</p><p>j: its really ominous going down the elevator and its kinda slow.
another
one thats interesting witht these types of layers is the acropolis
museum in athens. if you go to athens go to the acropolis. its the exact
same shape and orientation as the acropolis. and htno n the first flor
its like hovering an excavated part of ancient athens. you walk in and
you have this epic entrance. and then you enter with piece of hte
acropolis deconstructed on each side. as you make your way up you see
through the window of it the whole time. the decoratiosn as they relate.
and then the frieze that would go atop the pediment. so its like
echoing the architecture the whole time and at the very top theres a
little model of the. its really like outlining how you enter where you
enter. the first floor is its own stuff. then the top thing is about the
exact footprint of the acropolis. each part. the rhythm of hte windows.
its all echoing the meaning of whats happening on each floor. but then
thats why its kinked. its pushing. whys that overhang like that? bc its
covering the archaeologicl site. and its this giant porch and obvious
entrance that implies how you would enter the original building. like
what we talked about in the greek section. on the very top floor you get
to the acropolis and see down through all the layers to the ground
floor.</p><p>At night the texture&#x27;s the same. when modern
architecture&#x27;s done properly its fantastic. when its done terribly its
terrible. yo ucan see how clear and simple it can be. that little pinky
sticking out of the corner is all you need. even that triangle is a
reminder of the shape langauge of thte original building.</p><p>q: does it create a question of i need to go look at that?</p><p>a:
yeah. they do it even with this journey and hierarchy. you feel like
you kinda gotta go through the gauntlet throughout the whole bulding.
its a really powerful payoff at the end. even the lighting and shading
depreives you and then you get the relief. its very choreographed. and
then they can project stuff onto it too. very cool
on piranesi
its
looking at the ruin and deconstructing it. hes got studies of the ruins
and he did architecture that was playing with it. its about the journey
and asymmetry. hes got a lot of great etchings. its kinda nightmarish.
my painting of noxus was pretty inspired by this.</p><p>d: it was cool seeing these in person but theyre really big. carlos museum.
i have a large print view of his. it feels like you should be inside the drawing.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.org/details/sketchesbysamuel00prourich/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/sketchesbysamuel00prourich/mode/2up</a></p><p>the
first sentene describes how we like to see the age and ascribe huma
nattributes to these buildings like its a person. when im doing my
concept aret im trying to think of it like painting my grandmothers
hands. something thats both intimate and shows time. how the building
feels through the expression of time. we see the aging of it as if the
city is a person. the same reason why these ruins works. lotr. you feel
the age and thats why the new one leaves you going &quot;theres something
wrong&quot;
it doesnt feel as emotionally impactful.</p><p>q:how technical does it have to be?</p><p>a:
its still has to be technical but.. samuel prout kept messing up
drawings bc not bc it wasnt tight enough but bc he wasnt capturing
something like the strucutalness. if hte technical aspect is getting in
the way of the emotional impact then its not working. its that kind of
control. disney was looking at prouts stuff presumabely bc its sound but
still playful. there might be some exaggeration and some tilt. prout
was playing with it when he was younger. be your own harshest critic.
itll get you to improve. am i achieving it? constantly critique.</p><p>q: when architects see safety regulations do they see it as a challenge or barrier?</p><p>a:
its a pretty big barrier. and theres a lot of them. some of those
regulations force &quot;an answer&quot; it forces you to assess your decisions in a
more utilitarian way. other times it derails it.</p><p>q: god of war elfheim - norse architecture that doesnt exist but feels right</p><p>a:
yeah so.. one of them was. there was like a shot of hte temple over a
lake and that placid lake was a big part of the landscape. how do you
create more space for this level to occur.. i had a thing where the
thing was cutting down into the water. the building of itself was
building off the sense of a boat. theres some kind of sail. the main
thing that kind of unlocked a lot of the architecture was referencing
carvings of norse stuff. so kind of hte metallurgy and wood had carvings
in it with a weaving pattern. if htere wasa trench on the side how
would it articulate in more spaces. what if it was super solid. what if
the other parts ofh te drawing protrude to create platforming
opportuntiies. and then that became the serpent in the wall. and that
became literal carving. i wanted it to be more sparse but the metal
stuff that came back into it as filigree in between the negative shapes
of the elfheim stuff. it was inspiring for the large shape and for the
small shapes. monolithic stone strucutres. i think there was a lot of
stone-carved theres a stone-carved tradition in armenian culture thats
very similar. you also see it in irish cross-mounds. the armenian ones
are like monolithic slabs with multiple layers. the patterning was</p><p>similar so what if the side of the stone trench was carved in a similar
way.</p><p>q: how would you approach modern stuff like electric/ac
units? just bc brutalism seems like so much putting it into the
architecture itself</p><p>a:one thing that can be done is.. maybe this
admin unit could be it. maybe it extends father out and has like
ventilation slots inside this kinda casing. i could make it higher or
lower or stick out but i dont want to do it here. if it was a house
maybe i can point it out to accentuate the area of a chimeny. in this
case its about books so i dont wanna distract with that.</p><p>q:is there a rationale between using shape language like circles square triangles</p><p>a:
i think its more about a cubist mind and doing away with curly shapes
of art nouveau and deco. its trying to find the plainer language.
neoplatonic squares/triangles which is why you get these stark shapes.
early brutalist buildings like from corbusier have curves and are very
sculptural.
louis kahn is postmodern as it should be. ratios as they should be and not a pastiche..
without slapping on.</p><p>q: what do you do when have too many choices and decisions and questions</p><p>a:
thats the thing.. theyre very useful in an architective process. so
whats important is that you always refer to the visual whenever youre
making any conceptual ideas. always refer back to okay how will this be
expressed. why will it be expressed. test it. as soon as you have the
idea get it on paper. i dont get into notetaking and writing as much but
keep it in mind and put marks on the paper immediately. keep these
ideas as youre making marks on the page. its a much.. more.. as youre
drawing process. the way architects do that is with little diagrams.
square tilt cut really abstract. you can do that too. i might do some
analysis in plan mode but in order to do that effectively for concept
art. you have to have enough of those done to know what that plan means.plans only for architects. it used to be trained into your hand but now
the computer does it fro you. but if you look at old architects they
can do it with a napkin sketch. you can try to start to see the building
as youre going through your ideas. the other thing is to strart
painting immediately. as youre painting ask questions. labyrinth. how
can i bring thatb back into it but keep your hand moving.</p><p>q: first time teacher</p><p>“shit. noone’s ever asked that before”
dont be afraid. dont be afraid to mess up. and just.. think of it as
something for you to grow vs being there to know everything. you ahve
some expertise so feel comfortable that youre ocntirbuting something.
but also be comf youre learning a whole new thing
teaching
funamental pieces that yorue working with. stay yoruself. stay
comfortable. if they just wanted osme insight the ycould just go on
yotuube.</p><p>q: whats your favorite warmup?</p><p>a:im bad i dont do warmups. i should and i dont. circles parallel lines etc</p><p>q: do you have trouble transferring traditional/digital skills?</p><p>a:
i um.. yeah i know what you mean. yknow wahts funny its so much more
efficient sometimes. painting vs drawing. &quot;lemme try drawing it&quot; and
then it just works. would i have done that if i were painting it? i dont
think i wouldve.</p><p>ar: yeah sometimes i fall back into processes that give certain results</p><p>g:
sometimes just disconnect from it and just draw. even on JFO. what i
doing?! what am i <em>actually</em> doing?! your also fighting ego. fighting
ego a lot. dont think of it as an ends justify the means. i&#x27;ll do the
photobashing approach that doesnt go anywhere. and then the drawing gets
everyone excitded. concept arts become enamored with sargent matte
painting. yeah its really enticing but if you talk to an environment artist theyll get more excited by the drawing. theyll even get more excited by the render. sometimes its do
what you need to
do and its about the final thing. some folks on JFO were meticulously
crafting a scene. i would have like a day sometimes so id just throw
something together. 2 days for illum. i had to just do it quick. i had
to be comfortable with how i did it but hey if i dont have time to do
the painting.. so its for the artist at that point. even though it was
at full production. its really for the team. if its judged for if its
about being the finished piece theyre doing it wrong bc theyre gonna be
circling bc they havent solved it yet. im just gonna stay true to what
leads to the best result bc ive tested it a couple times. theres a
reason i ckeep saying this stuff bc yeah it is like.. i get a sense of
insecurity if im wasting time. im gona present a drawing and theyre
gonna rpesent a full unreal scene?!?!</p><p>its great to be challenged
by the new tools. had blender set up and then jama has a whole universe
built already it was also kind of.. i worked w some supervisers that
just wanted me to paint it like an artist. know that your ingredient is
crucial to the outcome even if other artists are doing crazy sutff. your
ingredient might contribut and even solve a huge problem that the
others arent even approaching. doug reminded me of that. he had a little
napkin sketch that was like &quot;yes!!!&quot; sometimes ti about doin a little
baby drawing and coming back.
capture it while its
there.how
am i gonna build this whole set if i dont even know if its the right
answer? its incumbent of you as the designer to check your potential
potholes and avoid them. or make sure oure process is capturing those
butterflies. the real rendering is by the environment artists when they
do it. you could probably design a whole game without going into crazy
rendering.</p><p>art direction latency.
if i draw it it takes like 2 hrs if i build it and mock it up it might look gorgeous and it might take me a couple days.
either
extend prepro to years or solve things quick. they may see it they may
not see it. if the ycan see it in a sketch you probably just saved
millions of dollars. straight up the whole production gets delayed. if i
do it this way then i move things along for the whole team and can
work on 4-5 environments at the same time. im about getting the whole
train moving bc im not building the game. im building the art thats
gonna build the game. im the fuel to the team. im the fuel that gets us
to the finish line but that means i help the art director find what they
havent been able to find yet. help them find what fails and succeeds
quickly.
you have to do all those things. craig mullins your
paychecks proportionate to your drawing skills. if you wanna succeed and
not just be the renderer and be part of the process.. if you show that
potential up front youre already big foot in. you do need everything and
to take it a ful lfinish render. but the q is how efficient do you take
it to the finish line. among all those beautiful illustrations and
renderings on artstation theyre looking for designers. custom jobs. you
need someone nimble, quick, something something. help soilf problems
quickly and efficiently. even for my team.. aside from any of hte
interviews and stuff .art director poulled me over and asked me to solve
several planets. and he could tell that i can potentially solve it. you
can have a stack of renderings that dont give you a solution. sometimes
the diagram can be the key to the lock. it might seem like a luxury but
its not really. the drawings are keys to the paintings and i usually
turn in paintings. today i did a few paintings and explored a specific
thing. on the side in my notebook i wrote on the site.</p><p>sometimes even illustrators need help bc theyre focused on the execution and not
discovering the design.</p><p>the cadence: 3 paintings sentence 3 paintings</p><p>collect
the reference and self art-direct and give him something nice and
thought out that speaks on its own. that shoudl be hte target and if you</p><p>can defvelop teh skillset for it youll still need to be able to draw
in your head. its happening to yall where these matrixes are forming
where you start analyzing and see these connections but you need to
develop your hand to be able to execute. what that means is that the
fasted way to catch the butterfly is to draw it while thinking about it.
so long as youre doing that . everyhing else (photoshop, 3d, photobash)
is a delay and you need to close that gap to capture butterflies as
fast as possible. reduce the latency.</p><div class="references-block"><h3>Referred in</h3><div><div><a class="reference" href="/mimo/architecture-for-worldbuilding-gabrielyeganyan"><div><h5>Architecture for World Building with Gabriel Yeganyan </h5></div></a></div></div></div></div><a aria-current="page" class="obstructed-label" href="/mimo/architecture-for-worldbuilding-gabrielyeganyan-wk7">Architecture for World Building with Gabriel Yeganyan Week 7</a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/architecture-for-worldbuilding-gabrielyeganyan-wk7";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-eb4ca9c3dc5cf6afbdbe.js"],"app":["/app-a5990959d989174caa04.js"],"component---node-modules-gatsby-theme-garden-src-templates-local-file-js":["/component---node-modules-gatsby-theme-garden-src-templates-local-file-js-f3890eda27d5222076f3.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/mimo/polyfill-eb4ca9c3dc5cf6afbdbe.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/mimo/component---node-modules-gatsby-theme-garden-src-templates-local-file-js-f3890eda27d5222076f3.js" async=""></script><script src="/mimo/styles-0ec71dd62c66cb95665c.js" async=""></script><script src="/mimo/app-a5990959d989174caa04.js" async=""></script><script src="/mimo/framework-a203e735b8148465a212.js" async=""></script><script src="/mimo/webpack-runtime-58e6e8a79d3c6c3e9c87.js" async=""></script></body></html>
